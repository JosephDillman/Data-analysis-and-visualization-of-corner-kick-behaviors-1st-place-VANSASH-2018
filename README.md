# Data-analysis-and-visualization-of-corner-kick-behaviors-1st-place-VANSASH-2018

The Vancouver Sports Analytics Symposium and Hackathon (VANSASH) was sponsored by the Vancouver Whitecaps, a Major League Soccer football club seeking new insights into their raw data. Over 100 hackers were given 60,000 rows of .csv data and 8h to find something interesting. My team and I decided to analyse the corner kick behaviours found in rival MLS teams.

I designed a python program to interpret, analyse and visualize the placement, angle, left vs right kick distinction, and success of corner kicks performed by rival teams in the MLS. My project partners graphed the more specific corner kick angles attempted by other teams. For this hackathon, my group and I took home 1st place!

Because I signed an NDA I cannot provide the raw data but feel free to view our power point presentation!
*Excuse the brevity of my code, it was written in a few hours
